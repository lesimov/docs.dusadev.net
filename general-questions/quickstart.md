General function and config files are openly available to you. Doing the necessary operations in these sections is enough to customize the script.

### I am using the key of the account I bought but still the same problem? <a href="#i-am-using-the-key-of-the-account-i-bought-but-still-the-same-problem" id="i-am-using-the-key-of-the-account-i-bought-but-still-the-same-problem"></a>

The first thing you need to do is to check the [status.cfx.re](https://status.cfx.re/) site to see if there is a problem with the keymaster or the game. If there is no problem, check if your key is inactive.
