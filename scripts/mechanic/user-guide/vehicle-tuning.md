## Stance & Fitment

Advanced wheel and suspension positioning.

**📹 Note**: *Stance tuning is advanced - video demonstration recommended.*

### Wheel Fitment

**Offset Adjustment:**
- Negative offset: Wheels pushed out (wider stance)
- Positive offset: Wheels tucked in (narrow stance)
- Range: Usually -50mm to +50mm

**Track Width:**
- Front track: Front axle width
- Rear track: Rear axle width
- Wider = more stable, aggressive look
- Narrower = less stable, compact look

**Wheel Size:**
- Diameter: 17" to 24"
- Width: 7" to 13"
- Larger = better looks, worse ride
- Wider = more grip, worse fuel economy

### Camber Adjustment

**Camber** is the angle of the wheel:

```
Positive Camber:  /  \    (top out)
Zero Camber:      |  |    (straight)
Negative Camber:  \  /    (top in)
```

**Effects:**
- Slight negative (-1 to -3°): Better cornering
- Extreme negative (-5 to -10°): "Stance" look, worse handling
- Positive camber: Off-road use only

**Front vs Rear:**
- Adjust independently
- Balance affects handling
- Match to driving style

### Suspension Height

**Ride Height Adjustment:**
```
Lowered -50mm:  Slammed look, scrapes
Lowered -30mm:  Sport look, practical
Lowered -10mm:  Subtle drop
Stock:          Factory height
Raised +20mm:   Light off-road
Raised +50mm:   Full off-road
```

**Considerations:**
- Lowered looks good but scrapes bumps
- Raised handles off-road but looks truck-like
- Adjust front/rear independently for rake

### Stance Presets

**Popular stance styles:**

**Hellaflush:**
- Maximum negative camber
- Lowered as far as possible
- Wheels flush with fenders
- Stretched tires

**VIP Style:**
- Moderate drop
- Large chrome wheels
- Slight negative camber
- Luxury look

**Track Setup:**
- Lowered suspension

- Wider track width
- Performance focused

**Off-Road:**
- Raised suspension
- Zero/positive camber
- Narrower track (sometimes)
- Clearance focused

### Engine Swap Process

1. **Select Engine Swaps tab** in tuning menu
2. **Choose new engine** from available options
3. **Review specifications:**
   - Power output
   - Torque curve
   - Weight impact
   - Handling changes
   - Cost
4. **Preview** (can test drive if enabled)
5. **Confirm purchase** - THIS IS PERMANENT
6. **Engine installed immediately**

### Engine Swap Effects

**Performance changes:**
- Acceleration
- Top speed
- Braking distance (due to weight)
- Handling balance
- Fuel consumption

**Handling impact:**
- Heavier engine = more front weight
- Affects steering feel
- May cause understeer/oversteer
- Suspension may need retuning

**Example: Compact car with V8 swap**
```
Before (I4):  0-60 in 7.5s, Top Speed 120mph, Neutral handling
After (V8):   0-60 in 4.2s, Top Speed 160mph, Understeer tendency
```

### Choosing the Right Engine

**Consider:**
- **Vehicle size**: Small cars + big engine = unpredictable
- **Purpose**: Racing? Daily? Show car?
- **Handling**: Will you enjoy the new characteristics?
- **Budget**: Can you afford it + other needed upgrades?

**Recommendations:**
- **Compact cars**: I4 or V6 max
- **Sedans**: V6 or V8
- **Sports cars**: V8 or V10
- **Supercars**: V10 or V12
- **Trucks**: V8 for towing power
