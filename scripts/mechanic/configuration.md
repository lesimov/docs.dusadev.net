## Configuration Files

The mechanic system uses multiple configuration files:

**Main Configuration:**
- `dusa_mechanicv2/shared/config.lua` - Core mechanic settings
- `dusa_mechanicv2/shared/config.mods.lua` - Vehicle modification definitions
- `dusa_mechanicv2/shared/config.tuning.lua` - Tuning system settings

**Note:** Configuration is a complex topic. This page provides an overview. Full configuration documentation will be added soon.

For now, refer to:
- [Installation Guide](installation.md) - Basic setup
- [Quick Start](quick-start.md) - Getting started
- Inline comments in config files
