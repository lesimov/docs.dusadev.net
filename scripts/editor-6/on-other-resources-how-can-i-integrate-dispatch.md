# On other resources, how can I integrate dispatch?

First, since the script is fully compatible with **ps-dispatch,** check if ps-dispatch is available in the dispatch options of the resource's **config** that you are using.\
If this option is already included, **simply select it**. At this stage, your process is complete.



If the resource you are using **does not support ps-dispatch** (which is a rare case), click the link below and integrate it into the open dispatch section of the resource.

#### Integration page:

{% content-ref url="how-to-send-custom-dispatch.md" %}
[how-to-send-custom-dispatch.md](how-to-send-custom-dispatch.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
