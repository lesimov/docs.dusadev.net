# Getting Started

Welcome to your first hunting adventure! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start hunting.

## Step 1: Get Your Hunting License

Before you can legally hunt, you need a hunting license.

1. **Find the Hunting Shop**
   - Look for the hunting shop blip (🦌) on your map
   - Default locations are usually near wilderness areas

2. **Purchase a License**
   - Interact with the shop NPC
   - Select "Buy Hunting License"
   - Pay the fee (configurable by server)
   - Keep the license in your inventory

⚠️ **Warning**: Hunting without a license may result in illegal hunting status and law enforcement alerts!

## Step 2: Buy Equipment

You'll need basic equipment to start hunting:

### Essential Items

| Item | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Hunting Rifle/Bow** | To hunt animals | ⭐⭐⭐ Required |
| **Hunting Knife** | To harvest animals | ⭐⭐⭐ Required |
| **Hunting Bait** | Attract animals | ⭐⭐ Recommended |
| **Animal Trap** | Passive hunting | ⭐ Optional |

### Optional Items

- **Tent**: For setting up camp
- **Campfire Kit**: To cook meat on-site
- **Binoculars**: Spot animals from distance

## Step 3: Find a Hunting Zone

Hunting zones are marked on your map or can be found in wilderness areas.

1. **Travel to a Hunting Zone**
   - Check your map for designated hunting areas
   - Some zones may require certain levels

2. **Identify the Zone**
   - You'll see a notification when entering a hunting zone
   - Zone boundaries may be visible on your map

## Step 4: Your First Hunt

### Spotting Animals

- Walk quietly through the hunting zone
- Look for wildlife like deer, rabbits, boars, or coyotes
- Use bait to attract animals to your location
- Stay downwind to avoid spooking animals

### Taking the Shot

1. **Aim Carefully**
   - Headshots yield better quality pelts
   - Body shots may damage the pelt quality

2. **Choose Your Weapon**
   - Rifles: Best for large game (deer, boar)
   - Bows: Silent, good for all animals
   - Pistols: Small game only

3. **Fire When Ready**
   - Wait for a clear shot
   - Don't rush - scared animals run away

### Harvesting Your Kill

After successfully hunting an animal:

1. **Approach the Animal**
   - Walk up to the dead animal
   - You'll see an interaction prompt

2. **Harvest Materials**
   - Press the interaction key (default: E)
   - Select "Harvest Animal"
   - You'll receive:
     - Pelt (quality depends on shot placement)
     - Meat (raw, needs cooking)
     - Sometimes special items

3. **Quality Ratings**
   - ⭐⭐⭐ Perfect: Headshot, best rewards
   - ⭐⭐ Good: Clean kill
   - ⭐ Poor: Multiple shots or body damage

## Step 5: Sell or Process Your Loot

You have several options with your hunting loot:

### Option 1: Sell to Hunting Shop

- Return to the hunting shop
- Interact with the NPC
- Select "Sell Items"
- Receive money for pelts and meat

### Option 2: Cook the Meat

- Set up a campfire
- Use the cooking menu
- Cook raw meat into consumables
- Eat for hunger or sell cooked meat for more profit

### Option 3: Save for Quests

- Some quests require specific animal parts
- Check active quests before selling
- Quest rewards often better than selling

## Quick Tips for Beginners

📝 **Movement**
- Crouch-walk (Ctrl) to move silently
- Running scares away nearby animals

📝 **Time of Day**
- Dawn and dusk have more animal activity
- Some animals are nocturnal

📝 **Weapon Choice**
- Start with a rifle for easier hunting
- Unlock bow hunting as you level up

📝 **Inventory Management**
- Pelts and meat have weight
- Bring a vehicle to store larger hauls
- Don't overhunt - sell regularly

📝 **Illegal Hunting**
- Always carry your license
- Don't hunt protected species
- Respect hunting zones

## Progression System

As you hunt, you'll gain experience and level up:

- **Level 1-5**: Basic animals (rabbits, coyotes)
- **Level 6-10**: Medium game (deer, boar)
- **Level 11+**: Rare spawns and premium zones

### Tracking Your Progress

- Open the hunting menu (default key: F7)
- View your statistics
- Check current level and XP
- See unlocked zones

## Using Bait & Traps

### Placing Bait

1. Have bait in your inventory
2. Use the item or place via menu
3. Animals will be attracted to the area
4. Wait nearby for animals to approach

### Setting Traps

1. Place a trap in a strategic location
2. Optionally add bait near the trap
3. Return later to check the trap
4. Collect trapped animals

⚠️ Remember trap locations - they don't show on map!

## Camping & Cooking

For longer hunting trips:

1. **Deploy Your Tent**
   - Find a flat area
   - Use tent from inventory
   - Creates a rest point

2. **Start a Campfire**
   - Use campfire kit
   - Place near your tent
   - Interact to access cooking menu

3. **Cook Your Catch**
   - Select raw meat from inventory
   - Choose cooking option
   - Wait for cooking to complete
   - Cooked meat restores hunger

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Hunting without a license** - Risk of wanted level
❌ **Using wrong weapon** - Damages pelt quality
❌ **Over-encumbering** - Can't run with too much weight
❌ **Forgetting knife** - Can't harvest without it
❌ **Ignoring quests** - Missing bonus rewards
❌ **Hunting near roads** - Fewer spawns, police nearby
